                        Anjit Suhag is an accomplished yoga instructor who has
                        trained approximately 200,000 people in yoga over the
                        course of 2-3 years. His fitness journey began in 2017
                        as a runner, and his love for fitness has only grown
                        since then.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In 2020, Anjit discovered the practice of Mudgar and
                        began to learn it. During his journey, he realized that
                        there were issues with the way Mudgar was being taught.
                        Many people were unaware of this ancient art, and those
                        who were aware were charging exorbitant amounts for the
                        practice and selling Mudgars at unaffordable prices.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Anjit decided to start his own teaching journey, making
                        the practice of Mudgar more accessible and affordable.
                        He began to manufacture and sell premium quality Mudgars
                        made of Mahaghani wood at a reasonable price. This gave
                        Anjit a purpose to start his Har-Ghar Mudgar journey,
                        where he aims to teach Mudgar to every household and
                        spread this practice as far as possible.
